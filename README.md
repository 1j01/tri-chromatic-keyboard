# [Tri-Chromatic Keyboard][app]

This is an implementation of
Roy Pertchik's [Tri-Chromatic Keyboard Layout][]
as a [web app][app].

You can select a scale to highlight and can optionally disable keys outside that scale.
The application supports mouse, pen, touch, and keyboard inputs.

(The keyboard support currently assumes a QWERTY layout,
which is possibly ironic for a project
focused on reinventing the keyboard.)

Uses [MIDI.js][] for audio output.

### TODO:
* Allow switching instruments and configuring effects
* Choose keyboard layout mapping by swiping across keys
